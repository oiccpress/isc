# ISC XML export

This plugin helps OJS talk with the ISC (Islamc World Science & Technology
Monitoring and Citation Institute) with their fast XML system.

Currently this plugin can export XML files used for uploading manually into the fast XML system.

**Soon** we will have the ability to use the XML WebService to send zip files
automatically into the system.
