# ISC XML export

This plugin helps OJS talk with the ISC (Islamc World Science & Technology
Monitoring and Citation Institute) with their fast XML system.

Currently this plugin can export XML files used for uploading manually into the fast XML system.

**Soon** we will have the ability to use the XML WebService to send zip files
automatically into the system. Currently this is broken and we are working with ISC to get
this functionality working (stay tuned!)
